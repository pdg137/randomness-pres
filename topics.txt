Randomness in testing
- normal testing: try edge cases
- it's easy to find edge cases when you have a good geometric picture
- "fuzz testing" finds more difficult edge cases (higher-dimensional picture)
  * fuzz testing kata example
  * note: will generally be more simple-minded
  * NOT supported by rspec in any way
- Another use for randomness: test order
  * test order kata example
  * sources of test interdependence: databases, global variables, files, external APIs
  * rspec --order rand (not the default)
- What to do when a test randomly fails?
  * random seeds
  * rspec --seed 1234
  * srand RSpec.configuration.seed (not controlled by --seed!)
  * putting it together - re-use the seed 
  * putting it together code
- Other examples of randomness in testing
  * code mutation
  * unavoidable randomness (e.g. network APIs)
  * testing random code
